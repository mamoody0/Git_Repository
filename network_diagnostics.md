The script network_diagnostics.ps1 performs these tasks:

It defines a list of servers to check.
It goes through each server in the list and tries to ping it.
Based on the operating system (Windows or Linux), it uses different commands to check connectivity.
If the server responds to the ping, it’s reachable. If not, it's not reachable.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Define the Servers to Check

powershell
$servers = @("8.8.8.8", "1.1.1.1", "google.com")
$servers: This line sets up a list of servers we want to test. We’re using three:
8.8.8.8 (a Google DNS server)
1.1.1.1 (a Cloudflare DNS server)
google.com (Google’s website)

Check Each Server

powershell
foreach ($server in $servers) {
foreach: This tells PowerShell to go through each item in the $servers list one by one.
$server: This variable represents each server in the list as we check it.

Check if the System is Linux

powershell
if ($IsLinux) {
if ($IsLinux): This checks if the script is being run on a Linux system.
If true, it runs the Linux ping command.
If false, it assumes we’re on Windows and runs a different command.

On Linux: Using the Ping Command

powershell
$result = ping -c 1 $server 2>&1
ping -c 1 $server: This sends a single ping to the server (only works on Linux).
-c 1: This means "count 1" — it only sends one ping to check the server.

powershell
if ($result -match "Name or service not known" -or $result -match "100% packet loss") {
    Write-Output "$server is not reachable."
} else {
    Write-Output "$server is reachable."
}
if ($result -match "..."): This checks the ping result for specific errors.
Name or service not known: This message means the server name isn’t recognized.
100% packet loss: This means the server didn’t respond.
Write-Output: This prints whether the server is reachable or not.

On Windows: Using Test-NetConnection

powershell
$result = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName $server
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName $server: This command tries to ping the server and works only on Windows systems.

powershell
if ($result.PingSucceeded) {
    Write-Output "$server is reachable."
} else {
    Write-Output "$server is not reachable."
}
if ($result.PingSucceeded): This checks if the ping was successful.
$result.PingSucceeded: Returns True if the server responded, False if it didn’t.
Write-Output: Prints whether each server is reachable.

Example Output
Running this script might give results like:

8.8.8.8 is reachable.
1.1.1.1 is reachable.
google.com is not reachable.
This means:

The first two servers (8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1) responded to the ping.
The third server (google.com) did not respond, so it may not be reachable.

Summary
This script is helpful for quickly testing if key servers are accessible from your computer, whether you're on Windows or Linux.
